- Prepare data with Tensorflow_Prepare_Data.ipynb

- Run training with Tensorflow_train.ipynb

Trained model is saved via tf.saved_model.simple_save()

- Predictions? Right now I don't achieve to call the saved model... It seems a sort of server needs to be implemented? Or should I just output the best weights/bias in text files, then construct my own predicting function?
